    "# Modeling Human Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Models of human behavior enable us to explore and describe people’s cognition, behaviors, and environments in which they are situated. We define behaviors as sequences of situatoins people find themselves in and actions they perform in those situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/sequence.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Human behavior are thus physical actions and emotions that people exhibit. Although there are many kinds of behaviors, we will focus on modeling human routine behavior. We define routine behaviors as \"likely, weakly ordered, interruptible sequences of situations and actions that a person will perform in those situations to create or reach opportunities that enable the person to accomplish a goal\" ([Banovic et al, 2018](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/computational-interaction-9780198799603?cc=us&lang=en&)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational models, or mathematical representions of such complex systems of behaviors and environments, enable us to apply various computational modeling methods for exploring the systems by simulation and prediction. Such computational models and methods enable next generation of behavior-aware User Interfaces that can automatically reason about and act in response to people’s behaviors. In this module, we teach you how to create such computational models of human behavior. We will illustrate [a recent behavior modeling approach](http://dl.acm.org/authorize?N03134) based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We will use a Python implementation of Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning from [Brian Ziebart's PhD thesis (2010)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bziebart/publications/thesis-bziebart.pdf) borrowed from [krasheninnikov/max-causal-ent-irl](https://github.com/krasheninnikov/max-causal-ent-irl).\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse Reinforcement Learning is particularly well suited for this problem because it allows us to mathematically  express our definition of human routine behavior and to capture and estimate the preference that people have for different goal situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to follow a computaional modeling pipeline. However, our focus in this module will primarely be on building a computational model base on Inverse Reinforcement Learning.\n",

    "Inverse Reinforcement Learning uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to encode behaviors. Here we briefly summarize details from and how it applies to [modeling human behaviors](http://dl.acm.org/authorize?N03134). A Markov decision process is a tuple. It consists of a set of states representing situations  people find themselves in, and actions that a person can take in those situations. In addition, the model includes an action-dependent probability distribution for each state transition p(s'|s,a), which specifies the probability of the next state s'\n",
    " when the person performs action a in state s. This state transition probability distribution models how the environment responds to the actions that people perform in different\n",
    "states. When modeling human behavior, the transitions are often stochastic (each pair (s, a) can transition to many transition states s' with different probabilities). However, if the person has full control over the environment, they can also be deterministic (i.e., for each pair (s, a) there is exactly one transition state s' with probability 1). Finally, there is a reward function R that the person incurs when performing action a in state s, which represents the utility that people get from performing different actions in different contexts.\n",
